# Classifiers

First standardize the data to prevent the absolute values of a given feature to have undue influence
- To do this, first find the mean and divide by standard deviation

## Nearest Neighbors Classifiers
Biggest problem is that you have to calculate the distance for all the vectors in relation to each other so the complexity grows linearly for each feature vector

## Evaluation
